GT Class Search Webapp
======================

This README will explain anything about the inner workings of the code, and contain my collaboration statement.

    #Collaboration Statement
    #This project was completed without help from any human other than the contents of {GT: Webdev} meetings
    #Web resources used include the following resources:
        #many parts of the heroku documentation
            #https://devcenter.heroku.com/
        #the bottle.py website and documentation
            #http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html
        #the github documentation
            #https://help.github.com/
        #w3schools css and html references were used to help remind me of certain css and html related tools
            #http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp
            #http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp
        #additionally, some javascript related resources were used for some of the html5 and canvas related functionality.  This repository contains a file named "localtool.py" that contains a similar version of the tool that runs in python.  It uses the Calico Graphics module to achieve a similar user input and output as the html5 canvas tool does in this webapp.
